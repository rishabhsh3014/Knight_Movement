# Knight Movement in chessboard
In this React App the all possible movement of knight is shown in 8X8 chess board (where there is only one knight available on the board).
This React App uses [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/) and react-dnd-html5-backend which uses the HTML5 drag and drop API under the hood and hides its quirks.
